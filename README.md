# Discrete-Structure
### Content
We learned so many new things in this course includes set theory, proof techniques, relations, functions, recurrence relations, counting methods, graph theory, trees and finite automata. It should be possible to us, sudents, to apply the skills to situations in real world.

So far I have learned in this course were about logic and patterns in computer science and math. Knowing about concepts such as sets and algorithms improved me in resolving issues. Even though it was a little difficult for me to use these abilities because I don't know how to use it on computers, I am excited to use them for future projects!
