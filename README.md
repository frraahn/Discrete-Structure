# Discrete-Structure

This course introduces students to the principles and applications of discrete structure in the field of computer science. The topics that are covered in this course are set theory, proof techniques, relations, functions, recurrence relations, counting methods, graph theory, trees and finite automata. At the end of the course, the students should be able to use set theory, relations and functions to solve computer science problems, analyze and solve problems using recurrence relations and counting methods, apply graph theory and trees in real world problems and use deterministic finite automata finite state machines to model electronic devices and problems.

So far I have learned in this course were about logic and patterns in computer science and math. Knowing about concepts such as sets and algorithms improved me in resolving issues. Even though it was a little difficult for me to use these abilities because I don't know how to use it on computers, I am excited to use them for future projects!
